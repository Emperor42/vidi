Visual Internet Database Interface (VIDI): Allows for the creation of a noSQL database which is based on HTML forms to store the data both records and structure of the records.
The insights can be furthered by processing down into XML documets, which can be directly viewed or parsed as JSON payloads.

Well Integrated with VENI and VICI
